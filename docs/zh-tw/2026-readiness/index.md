# 2026 年 ISO 20022 就緒

距 **2026 年 11 月 14 日** 還有 **108 天**（截至 2026-07-29）。

自該日起，完全非結構化的郵政地址將不再被 SWIFT CBPR+ 付款訊息以及英格蘭銀行的 CHAPS 驗證程式庫接受。同一天另有兩項變更生效，2027 年 11 月將有更大範圍的變更。

Every rule below carries an identifier, an effective date, an authoritative source and a test fixture, so nothing here has to be taken on trust.

## 這是否影響到您

若您傳送的 CBPR+ 或 CHAPS 付款中包含任一當事方的郵政地址，即屬適用範圍。

| | |
|---|---|
| **訊息** | `pacs.008`, `pacs.009`, `pacs.004`, `pacs.003` |
| **當事方** | Debtor, creditor, ultimate debtor, ultimate creditor, and agents that carry an address |
| **不在範圍內** | `admi.024`, `camt.025`, `camt.052`, `camt.053`, `camt.054`, `camt.060` |
| **豁免** | Agents identified by BIC alone need no postal address (`CBPR-ADDR-005`) |

## 實際改變了什麼

該要求是**下限而非上限**。這是此強制規定中最常被誤讀的部分。

| Format | `TwnNm` | `Ctry` | `AdrLine` | Before 14 Nov 2026 | On or after |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fully structured | Present | Present | Absent | Accepted | Accepted |
| Hybrid | Present | Present | Present | Accepted | **Accepted** |
| Fully unstructured | Absent | Absent | Present | Accepted | **Rejected** |

您**無需**將街道、門牌號碼與郵遞區號移入結構化元素。在 `<TwnNm>` 中填寫城市、在 `<Ctry>` 中填寫兩位 ISO 3166 國家代碼即可。其餘內容可保留在地址行中：這屬於混合位址，依然有效。

## 立即檢查您的資料

兩項工具，皆完全在您的瀏覽器中執行。不會傳送任何付款資料。

- **[Batch address scan](/live/)** — upload a CSV of party addresses and get a
  readiness score, a breakdown by party, and a downloadable remediation list of
  the records that would fail.
- **[XSD validation](/live/)** — check an existing message against the official
  schema for element order, cardinality and datatypes.

## 測試檔案

Run these through the workbench, the CLI or the API. Each maps to the rule it
exercises, so you can confirm your pipeline reacts the way you expect.

- [`structured-valid.csv`](/fixtures/cbpr/address/structured-valid.csv) — passes `CBPR-ADDR-001`
- [`hybrid-valid.csv`](/fixtures/cbpr/address/hybrid-valid.csv) — passes `CBPR-ADDR-001`
- [`unstructured-invalid.csv`](/fixtures/cbpr/address/unstructured-invalid.csv) — fails `CBPR-ADDR-001`
- [`missing-town-invalid.csv`](/fixtures/cbpr/address/missing-town-invalid.csv) — fails `CBPR-ADDR-002`
- [`missing-country-invalid.csv`](/fixtures/cbpr/address/missing-country-invalid.csv) — fails `CBPR-ADDR-003`
- [`agent-bic-only-valid.csv`](/fixtures/cbpr/address/agent-bic-only-valid.csv) — passes `CBPR-ADDR-005`
- [`hybrid-valid.csv`](/fixtures/chaps/address/hybrid-valid.csv) — passes `CHAPS-ADDR-001`
- [`unstructured-invalid.csv`](/fixtures/chaps/address/unstructured-invalid.csv) — fails `CHAPS-ADDR-001`

## 所有時程，而不只是這一個

2026 年 11 月並非 ISO 20022 變更的終點。自該日起 Swift 轉為年度 Standards Release 週期，使用指南將逐年變動。

| Date | Scheme | Change | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `2025-11-22` | CBPR+ | Hybrid postal address option available | `CBPR-ADDR-004` |
| `2025-11-22` | CBPR+ | MT/MX coexistence for payment instructions ends | — |
| `2026-11-14` | CBPR+ | Fully unstructured postal address rejected | `CBPR-ADDR-001` |
| `2026-11-14` | CHAPS | CHAPS validation library rejects unstructured addresses | `CHAPS-ADDR-001` |
| `2026-11-14` | CBPR+ | MT101 interbank coexistence ends; contingency relays to `pain.001` | — |
| `2026-11-14` | Swift | `camt.110` investigation requests must be receivable | — |
| `2026-11-14` | Swift | Annual Standards Release cycle begins | — |
| `2027-11` | CHAPS | Purpose codes mandatory on all payments (announced) | `CHAPS-PURP-001` |
| `2027-11` | CHAPS | Structured remittance information mandatory (announced) | `CHAPS-RMT-001` |
| `2027-11` | Swift | `camt.110` and `camt.111` both mandatory (announced) | — |

## 依角色需檢查的事項

### 工程

- Find every place an address is concatenated into a single line before it
  reaches the message. That is usually where the problem is.
- Model town and country as separate fields end to end, not just at the
  boundary.
- Add `CBPR-ADDR-001` to `CBPR-ADDR-003` to your pre-submission validation,
  with the effective date, so failures surface before 14 November rather than
  on it.
- Add a negative test that a fully unstructured address is rejected. A rule you
  have never seen fire is a rule you cannot rely on.

### 資料

- Measure how many records are missing a structured town or country **now**, so
  the remediation effort is a number rather than a guess. The batch scan
  produces exactly this.
- Identify the authoritative source per field. Addresses often arrive from
  several systems with different conventions.
- Country must be a two-letter ISO 3166 code. `GB`, not `United Kingdom` or
  `GBR` — `CBPR-ADDR-003` fails on the latter two.

### 測試

- Test the day before, the day of, and the day after the effective date.
  Effective-date logic is where date-boundary bugs live.
- Test CBPR+ and CHAPS separately. They are modelled as distinct rules here for
  a reason.
- Include a hybrid address in the passing set. A test suite that only accepts
  fully structured addresses will reject valid traffic.

### 營運

- Know what a rejection for this reason will look like in your monitoring, and
  who triages it.
- Confirm your counterparties' readiness, not only your own. A compliant message
  can still fail if the receiving side is not ready.

### 管理層

- The exposure is the count of records that would fail today, not the count of
  systems. Ask for the number.
- Note the 2027 obligations below. Teams that treat November 2026 as the finish
  line will repeat this work in twelve months.

## 各方案之間的差異

| | SWIFT CBPR+ | Bank of England CHAPS |
|---|---|---|
| Unstructured rejected | 14 November 2026 | 14 November 2026 |
| Minimum acceptable | Hybrid | Hybrid |
| Enforced by | CBPR+ usage guidelines | CHAPS validation library |
| Purpose codes | Not mandated by this change | Mandatory for all payments from November 2027 |
| Structured remittance | Not mandated by this change | Mandatory from November 2027 |
| Rules here | `CBPR-ADDR-001` – `006` | `CHAPS-ADDR-001`, `CHAPS-PURP-001`, `CHAPS-RMT-001` |
